FizzBuzz
fizz.js

Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

Our users request that numbers that are multiples of seven will result in a "Sivv" (so, 105 will print "FizzBuzzSivv"). Actually, they have a list of 30 other numbers they'd like this program to handle in a similar fashion.
